# MovieFights
Compendium of Fights

The intention is to compile all of the movie fights (and then maybe tv fights) questions, answers, results, scores etc. into one repository for fan reference.

This is a continuation of partial work done previously by Wikipedia-user Andrewjshick and http://moviefights.surge.sh/ author Simon

This is also an opportunity for me to work on my CSS/Front-end skills so I won't be taking outside contributions beyond help adding episodes/information once the page's framework is written
